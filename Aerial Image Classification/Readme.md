## Aerial Image Classification

## Overview
Developed a multi-class classification pipeline for aerial images using the AID dataset. Applied transfer learning on models such as EfficientNet-B0, Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16), Swin Transformer, and ResNet variants to classify 30 distinct land-use and land-cover scene types. Achieved high accuracy and demonstrated the role of deep learning in geospatial applications like city planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster response.
