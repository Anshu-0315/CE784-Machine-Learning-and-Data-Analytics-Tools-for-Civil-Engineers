## Pavement Type Classification using Machine Learning
## Overview
Developed a time-series classification model using smartphone accelerometer data to identify pavement types (flexible pavement, cobblestone, and dirt roads). Implemented logistic regression and shallow neural networks with supervised learning on Kaggle competition data, achieving results evaluated through F1-score.
